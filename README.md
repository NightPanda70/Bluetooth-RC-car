# Bluetooth-RC-car
Making a Bluetooth app with android studio to control an RC car. 

I have no idea what I am doing and pretty much this is something I am figuring out as I go.
While there are a lot of examples for this type of application making one from scratch is 
more difficult then expected.

The reason why I am doing this is to connect my ESP32 to my phone using bluetooth.
This is a side project so I may never finish this project.
